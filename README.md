# 🎬 Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT | Hugging Face + PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to perform real-time sentiment analysis using the `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` transformer model from Hugging Face. It classifies input movie reviews as **Positive** or **Negative**, leveraging the power of pre-trained NLP models.

## 🚀 Why I Built This

As an aspiring AI/ML software engineer, I wanted to explore how production-ready NLP models work under the hood. This project helped me understand how to:

- Load and fine-tune Hugging Face transformers
- Tokenize and prepare raw text for model inference
- Work with PyTorch tensors and GPU acceleration
- Deploy fast, lightweight NLP pipelines

I’m passionate about building impactful AI systems — whether it's sentiment analysis, medical imaging, or agentic AI. This is one of several projects where I'm diving deeper into **language models and real-world inference pipelines**.
